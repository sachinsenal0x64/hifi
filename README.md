> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project will be ported to be compatible with Subsonic. Once that‚Äôs done, you‚Äôll be able to use any client that supports the Subsonic API. I can‚Äôt provide an ETA at the moment, but all current issues will be resolved in the next update. The previous API will be deprecated; however, all its endpoints will remain compatible with the Subsonic API. [API Docs](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/docs).

> [!TIP]
>
> #### The old v1 hosted [API](https://hifi.401658.xyz) will remain available until the subsonic update is merged. The [Docs](https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/hifi/tree/20f6adbc7b58cbda6183e600d6a554f86416e251?tab=readme-ov-file#-api-documentation-no-account-required) are available in the previous [commit](https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/hifi/tree/20f6adbc7b58cbda6183e600d6a554f86416e251)

## Quickstart

Soon...

<br>

## API

[API Docs](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/docs) |
[Hosted API](https://hifi.401658.xyz)

## How can I create my own app based on HiFi?

First, check which [routes](https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/hifi/tree/main/routes) are supported by Hifi. Hifi uses OpenSubsonic [API](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app), but that doesn‚Äôt mean it supports every endpoint that OpenSubsonic provides. Hifi only supports the necessary endpoints required to play music. For example, You can connect the Hifi server to [Feishin](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin) to observe how it works in practice.

## Installation (Self-host Hifi)

## Apps

> [!NOTE]  
> I will only add open-source clients here. There are many other apps compatible with subsonic, so please do your own research.
> The clients listed below work with HiFi. I have tested them myself. Any other clients that do not work will not be implemented in HiFi.
