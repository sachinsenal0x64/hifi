> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project will be ported to be compatible with Subsonic. Once that‚Äôs done, you‚Äôll be able to use any client that supports the Subsonic API. I can‚Äôt provide an ETA at the moment, but all current issues will be resolved in the next update. The previous API will be deprecated; however, all its endpoints will remain compatible with the Subsonic API. [API Docs](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/docs).

> [!TIP]
>
> #### The old v1 hosted [API](https://hifi.401658.xyz) will remain available until the subsonic update is merged. The [Docs](https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/hifi/tree/20f6adbc7b58cbda6183e600d6a554f86416e251?tab=readme-ov-file#-api-documentation-no-account-required) are available in the previous [commit](https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/hifi/tree/20f6adbc7b58cbda6183e600d6a554f86416e251)
