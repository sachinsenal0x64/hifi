> ### If the below guidelines are not complied with, your PR will be marked as invalid and closed without merging.

- Please check that your proposal is valid for the HiFi project.
  https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/hifi?tab=readme-ov-file#hifi-proposal-check

- Before send PR first open a issue then fork the repo.

- All of your commits should go to the **patch** branch. Please don't push to the main branch.

- Do not delete commented lines.

- Only modify/update or add extra code if needed, and do not break the current code style or structure. If a method is deprecated, you can replace it with the current one, for example The current code is inefficient; you may replace it with a more efficient version.

- Get familiar with https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/hifi/tree/main/routes
  , https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/hifi/tree/main/config
  , and https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/hifi/tree/main/middleware
  . Only add or modify existing code; do not change any layout.

- Don't hard-code every route; use the /routes folder as I mentioned above and learn how the folder is structured.

- Feel free to send PR's regarding spelling mistakes, incorrect grammar etc.

- Always add a comment when adding a new code block.
